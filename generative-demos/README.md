# Generative Mind Demos

This folder contains informal demonstration artifacts.

These demos are **not finished frameworks** and **not polished papers**.
They are produced as a way to:

- play with unfamiliar problem spaces,
- observe how structure emerges under zero preparation,
- calibrate generative capacity over time,
- and preserve raw traces of thinking before formalization.

Most demos are created for self-observation and exploration.
Only some may later be extracted, refined, or formalized for research use.

## Demos
