# Framework A — Illusion, Creativity & Generativity  
*A short conceptual sequence on how high-dimensional tension collapses into human-facing phenomena.*

---

## Entry Point

Framework-A reframes **illusion** as a structural overflow rather than an error.  
It explains how residual tension → collapse → projection → creativity → innovation.

If you’re new here, start with the Reading Guide below.

## 🔧 Reading Guide (Two Valid Paths)

### **1) Phenomenon → Mechanism** *(recommended)*  
Read **A01–A04 → then A0**.  
Good for readers who prefer to see the pattern first.

Covers:  
dimensional mismatch • framing overflow • creativity leakage • innovation seams • agency

### **2) Mechanism → Phenomenon**  
Read **A0 → then A01–A04**.  
Good for readers who prefer foundational mechanics.

Covers:  
pre-token tension • mapping before concepts • collapse • overflow

**If unsure: start with A01.**  
Both paths converge to:  
**tension → collapse → overflow → creativity → innovation → agency**

## Boundary Layer
The Boundary Layer contains conceptual probes that sit at the edge of Framework-A.  
These notes examine conditions where structure exists before validation, ownership, or collapse—  
revealing how illusion behaves at the system’s outer boundary.
- [Boundary Note D01 — Pre-Validation Structure, Ownership & Illusion](framework-A-boundary_D01_prevalidation-structure.md)

Explores illusion *before collapse*: unvalidated structure, ownership, and stabilization.
