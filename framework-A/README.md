# Framework A — Illusion, Creativity & Generativity  
*A short conceptual sequence on how high-dimensional tension collapses into human-facing phenomena.*

---

## Entry Point

Framework-A reframes **illusion** as a structural overflow rather than an error.  
It explains how residual tension → collapse → projection → creativity → innovation.

If you’re new here, start with the Reading Guide below.

## 🔧 Reading Guide (Two Valid Paths)

### **1) Phenomenon → Mechanism** *(recommended)*  
Read **A1–A4 → then A0**.  
Good for readers who prefer to see the pattern first.

Covers:  
dimensional mismatch • framing overflow • creativity leakage • innovation seams • agency

### **2) Mechanism → Phenomenon**  
Read **A0 → then A1–A4**.  
Good for readers who prefer foundational mechanics.

Covers:  
pre-token tension • mapping before concepts • collapse • overflow

**If unsure: start with A1.**  
Both paths converge to:  
**tension → collapse → overflow → creativity → innovation → agency**
