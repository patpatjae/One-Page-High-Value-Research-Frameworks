## Project Entry Point

This framework presents a conceptual sequence that reinterprets *illusion*
as a structural, generative, and human-centered phenomenon.

If this is your first time here, you may want to start with the overview.

- [How to Read This Conceptual Sequence](overview.md)

The one-pages below are designed to be read in order.
Each builds on the previous to form a coherent conceptual arc.
