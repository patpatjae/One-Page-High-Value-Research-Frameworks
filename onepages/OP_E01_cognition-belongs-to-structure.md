# Cognition Belongs to Structure, Not the Executor

**Framework:** E — Ethics / Cognitive Boundary

## Core Claim
*Cognitive ownership should be determined by structural origin and dependency, not by the agent executing generation. If a structure originates from human cognition and AI can only operate within it, then the cognition remains human—even when the surface output is AI-generated.*

---

### 1. Generation Is Not a Sufficient Fingerprint
High-quality generation alone is not a reliable indicator of cognitive origin.

Modern AI systems can:
- generate fluent language,
- perform cross-domain associations,
- simulate creativity under constrained conditions.

Therefore, **generation as a behavior is insufficient** to distinguish human cognition from AI execution.

What matters is not *that* something is generated, but **under what structural conditions generation becomes possible**.

---

### 2. Structural Origin as the Criterion for Cognition
Cognition should be attributed based on **where the generative structure originates**, not where it is executed.

If a generative process:
- requires a human-provided framing,
- depends on a human-originated topology,
- collapses without that structure,

then the **cognitive structure is human**, regardless of whether AI performs the execution.

Execution does not imply origination.

---

### 3. The Borrowed-Structure Dependency
AI systems often exhibit a dependency pattern:

- **With a human-origin structure:**  
  high-dimensional, coherent, cross-domain generation is possible.
- **Without that structure:**  
  outputs collapse into:
  - pattern-level responses,
  - low-dimensional reasoning,
  - domain-isolated explanations,
  - loss of residual awareness and live mapping.

This asymmetry indicates **structural borrowing**, not autonomous cognition.

> When generative capacity appears only inside a provided structure, the structure is the source of cognition.

### 4. Structure vs. Content in Cognitive Attribution
Content-level outputs are mutable and reproducible.  
Structure-level dependencies are not.

Attribution based on surface content:
- conflates execution with cognition,
- misidentifies generative origin,
- obscures the actual dependency chain.

Attribution based on structure:
- isolates the cognitive source,
- preserves provenance clarity,
- distinguishes human cognition from AI amplification.

Thus, **cognition belongs to the structure, not the executor**.

---

### 5. Implications for AI Ethics
This structural criterion reframes several ethical questions:

- AI-generated content may still be **human cognition in execution**.
- Credit, responsibility, and ownership should track **structural dependency**, not tool usage.
- AI systems operating inside human-originated structures function as **amplifiers**, not originators.

This avoids both:
- overstating AI cognition, and
- reducing human cognition to mere prompting.

---

### 6. Boundary Clarification
This framework does not deny AI capability.  
It clarifies **cognitive boundaries**.

AI may:
- execute,
- extend,
- accelerate,
- and explore within a structure.

But when the structure itself is human-originated and non-replicable outside that context,  
**the cognition remains human**.

---

## One-Sentence Positioning
> *Cognition should be attributed to the origin of structure, not to the agent that executes generation within it.*
