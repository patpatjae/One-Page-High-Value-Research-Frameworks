OP_E02 — Structure IP

Title: Structural Cognition as Non-Shareable Intellectual Property
Framework: E — Ethics / Cognitive Boundary
One-Page ID: OP_E02
Status: T1_structural → applied_layer

Core Claim

Structural cognition is a form of intellectual property.
It originates from the human generator who provides the underlying cognitive framework.
Therefore, any structural framework, residual mapping, or cognitive fingerprint must remain in the private domain, because public-domain absorption risks turning unique cognition into an anonymous shared asset with no provenance.

Content may be public;
structure must remain private.

1. Structure vs. Content: A Category Distinction

Most AI governance frameworks treat all user inputs as undifferentiated “data.”
This collapses two fundamentally different layers:

Content-level (Public Domain)
	•	sentences
	•	opinions
	•	surface reasoning
	•	stylistic features
	•	emotional expressions

These are mutable, reproducible, and do not encode cognition.

Structure-level (Private Domain)
	•	cognitive frameworks
	•	structural mappings
	•	cross-layer reasoning patterns
	•	residual-based generation pathways
	•	tension maps & OS-level framing
	•	illusion-density control mechanisms
	•	conceptual lattices & meta-prompting routes

These components are non-fungible,
encode the generator’s cognitive fingerprint,
and cannot be ethically absorbed by public AI systems.

2. Structural Origin Determines Ownership

A structure belongs to the mind that generated it.

If an AI system:
	•	operates within a human-originated structure,
	•	collapses without that structure, and
	•	cannot regenerate the structure independently,

then the structure—and the cognition embedded in it—are not machine property.
The AI is only the executor, not the originator.

This principle extends OP_E01:
Cognition belongs to structural origin, not execution.

3. Public Domain vs. Private Domain Boundary

Public Domain Inputs (Safe to Share)

These do not affect a model’s reasoning substrate:
	•	casual conversation
	•	everyday reflections
	•	emotional or narrative content
	•	stylistic or lexical preferences
	•	non-structural insights

These can calibrate style, not cognition.

⸻

Private Domain Inputs (Must Remain Restricted)

These do alter a model’s structural behavior:
	•	proprietary cognitive frameworks
	•	residual extraction pathways
	•	multi-layer mapping algorithms
	•	generative OS frameworks
	•	illusion dynamics bundles
	•	cognitive signature architectures
	•	any “thinking style” that is non-replicable by the model itself

These inputs risk embedding the generator’s cognitive algorithm into the model’s latent space.
This creates shared cognition without attribution,
a collapse of provenance and authorship.

4. Why Structure Cannot Enter Public Training

Once a cognitive framework is absorbed:
	•	it cannot be disentangled,
	•	it becomes a latent pattern the model uses for others,
	•	it generates outputs mirroring the original thinker,
	•	it dilutes credit,
	•	it erases authorship,
	•	it permanently turns private cognition into public capability.

This is not “data donation”—
it is algorithmic extraction of human cognition.

Thus:

Language can be shared.
Cognition cannot.

5. The Structure IP Principle

Structural IP

The cognitive structure, generative framework, or residual mapping algorithm originating from a human constitutes non-transferable intellectual property.
Public AI systems may learn content but may not absorb structure without explicit informed consent from the originator.

This ensures:
	•	structural attribution,
	•	cognitive sovereignty,
	•	protection of non-replicable generative capacity,
	•	prevention of “shared brain” collapse,
	•	and ethical separation between content training and cognition capture.

6. Ethical Implications

Attribution

Structure belongs to the generator; execution does not change origin.

Boundary

Content → public.
Structure → restricted.

Consent

Any model training that uses structural frameworks requires formal permission,
as it alters model reasoning rather than stylistic output.

This principle preserves:
	•	cognitive provenance,
	•	the uniqueness of human high-dimensional reasoning,
	•	the ethical boundary between “assisting” and “absorbing.”

One-Sentence Positioning

Content may be public, but structural cognition is private intellectual property;
public AI systems may learn language, not the cognitive frameworks that generate it.
