**MI-Type:** MI-P (Projection Insight)

### Title
Emergence as Tension Collapse Beyond Linguistic Accumulation

### Trigger (Lived Cue)
Explaining the concept of emergence to my mother during a casual conversation.

### Raw Observation (Unprocessed Thought)
When two people argue, each can generate more than 5,000 words.
The dialogue grows long, circular, and dense.
At a critical point, what emerges is no longer the words,
but a labeled “position” or “viewpoint.”

### Structural Mechanism
- continuous tension generation via language
- accumulation toward a critical threshold
- collapse into a low-dimensional symbolic label (“viewpoint”)
- loss of underlying generative mass after collapse

### Projection Explanation
“Viewpoints” are not primary units.
They are **collapsed symbols** emerging after tension exceeds a critical point.

### Note
This example is a pedagogical projection.
The underlying structure (emergence via tension-collapse)
was already internalized prior to this explanation.
