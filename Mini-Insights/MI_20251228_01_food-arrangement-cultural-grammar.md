## Title
Food Arrangement as Cultural Pattern Grammar

## Trigger (Lived Cue)
While cooking braised beef, I noticed my mother cut bamboo shoots into thin strips because the celery had been cut into strips.

## Raw Observation
Chinese dishes replicate shape-patterns (strips match strips, cubes match cubes).  
Western dishes isolate components with a strong residual presence.  
Pizza-like foods distribute ingredients in diffusion-style micro-patterns.

## Structural Mechanism
- local pattern alignment (strip-to-strip)  
- structural absorption of tension  
- node-based residual grammar in Western plating  
- global coherence distribution in pizza-style arrangements  

## Cross-Domain Echo
Reflects three major generative paradigms in AI:
- diffusion coherence  
- transformer-style local alignment  
- object-centric modeling  

## Why It Matters
This insight serves as an entry point for building a cross-cultural pattern grammar module within the SPA framework.
