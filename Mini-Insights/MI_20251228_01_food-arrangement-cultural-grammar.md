**MI-Type:** MI-D (Discovery Insight)

### Title
Food Arrangement as Cultural Pattern Grammar

### Trigger (Lived Cue)
While cooking braised beef, I noticed my mother cut bamboo shoots into thin strips because the celery had been cut into strips.

### Raw Observation (Unprocessed Thought)
“Chinese dishes replicate shape-patterns (strips match strips, cubes match cubes).
Western dishes isolate components with strong residual presence.
Pizza-like foods distribute ingredients in diffusion-style micro-patterns.”

### Structural Mechanism (Underlying Structure)
- local pattern alignment (strip-to-strip)
- structural absorption of tension
- node-based residual grammar in Western plating
- global coherence distribution in pizza-style arrangements

### Cross-Domain Echo (Mapping to Other Fields)
Reflects three generative paradigms in AI:
- diffusion coherence  
- transformer-style local alignment  
- object-centric modeling  

### Why It Matters
This serves as a **projection trace** showing how an already-internalized structural model
is mapped onto an everyday, embodied scenario.

### Note
This insight represents a *low-dimensional projection* of an existing structure,
used for explanation rather than discovery.
