(Projection-based Discovery Insight — Emergence via Tension Collapse)

Title  
Emergence as Tension Collapse:  
From Human Conflict to “Legalized Hibernation”

Trigger (Lived / Conceptual Cue)  
Questioning why humans, despite having many latent physiological mechanisms, do not hibernate in cold environments.

Raw Analogy (Unprocessed Mapping)  
In human conflict, two individuals can each generate thousands of words.
For a long time, this appears as noise: repetitive, emotional, unstructured.
Only at a critical point does a “viewpoint” emerge.
That viewpoint is not any single sentence,
but a collapse of accumulated tension into a named position.

Structural Mechanism  
• continuous low-level generation (≈ “5000 words”)  
• tension accumulation without definition  
• absence of an observer-level framing  
• critical threshold where naming occurs  
• collapse of diffuse tension into a stable structure (“viewpoint”)

Cross-Domain Projection  
Human physiology continuously generates energy-related signals:
latent hibernation genes, metabolic fluctuations, cold-stress responses.

Currently, due to the absence of a higher-dimensional observer capable of defining humans as an object of study,
these signals remain unrecognized and are treated as noise.

The proposal of “legalized hibernation” functions analogously to a viewpoint in an argument:
it is the critical naming event that collapses diffuse physiological tension
into a coherent, socially and biologically legible survival strategy.

Key Insight  
Emergence does not arise from new signals,
but from the moment accumulated tension is *defined*.

What appears as noise before definition
becomes structure after collapse.

One-Line Compression  
Legalized hibernation is not the invention of a new biological function,
but the emergence of a definition that collapses long-existing physiological tension into a stable strategy.
