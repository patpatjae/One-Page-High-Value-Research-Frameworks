# Dual-Relation Incompleteness Principle (DRIP)
### A residual-first criterion for distinguishing pattern-level observations from ontological DOFs

---

## 0. One-Sentence Positioning
Ontology becomes visible only when the dual relation between **observation** and **projection** is complete.  
If the dual relation is incomplete, all observations remain **pattern-level by necessity**.

## 1. Structural Motivation: Duality as the Operator of Ontology

Every observation sits inside a dual pair:

**Observation ↔ Projection Pattern**

This pair behaves as a **measurement operator**:  
it determines whether the system’s true degrees of freedom (DOFs) are even accessible.

- **Incomplete duality** → DOFs remain hidden  
- **Completed duality** → ontological structure becomes detectable  

Thus:

> **Incomplete duality → ontology cannot be inferred.**

## 2. Pattern-Locking: What Happens When Duality Is Incomplete

When the dual relation does not close, the system enters **pattern-locking**:

- observations attach only to surface patterns  
- structural identity remains invisible  
- unexplained outliers accumulate  
- the dimensionality of the model cannot stabilize  
- all reasoning remains **projection-bound**, regardless of sophistication  

This describes why many inquiries never reach mechanism space.

## 3. The Invariance Condition for Identifying Ontology

A structure is *ontological* only if it satisfies three invariances:

### **1. Pattern-Invariance**  
Stays stable across different projection schemas.

### **2. Domain-Invariance**  
Transfers across fields without distortion.

### **3. Measurement-Invariance**  
Its identity remains unchanged under different probing methods.

Only duality completion allows these invariances to be verified.

## 4. Duality-Completion Test (DCT)

A minimal test for distinguishing patterns from ontological DOFs:

### **(1) Outlier Absorption Test**  
Can the pattern absorb anomalies?  
- **Yes →** pattern-layer  
- **No →** residual DOF is exposed  

### **(2) Cross-Domain Portability Test**  
Does the structure migrate across domains?  
- **No →** pattern-layer  
- **Yes →** approaching ontology  

### **(3) Measurement Stability Test**  
Does changing the measurement basis change the observation?  
- **Yes →** pattern-layer  
- **No →** ontological

## 5. DOF-Stability: When the System Finally Reveals Its Core

A degree of freedom is ontological when:

- removing it destroys identity  
- it appears across multiple contexts  
- it functions as the **minimal unit of structural explanation**  

In your original line:

> **“A kernel is the piece that can migrate across domains.  
> A pattern cannot.”**

---

## 6. Final Statement

Duality incompleteness **forces** all observations to stay in the pattern layer.  
Duality completion **reveals** the kernel.

This formalizes my original insight:

> **“If the dual structure is incomplete, you can’t reach the ontology.”**
