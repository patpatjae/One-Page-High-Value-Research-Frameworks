# Residual-First Generative Modeling (RFGM)
### A kernel-origin framework for constructing cross-domain structure without inherited coupling

---

## 0. One-Sentence Positioning
Residual-first modeling begins from the invariant kernel—the only structurally non-removable element—and treats patterns as domain-specific projection schemas.  
This produces a stable, cross-domain generative model.

---

## 1. Structural Origin: Euclidean Decomposition

$$
A = kB + r,\quad A > B
$$

Interpretation:

- **kB**: repeatable, removable pattern  
- **r**: irreducible residual (kernel)

The universal split encoded by Euclid:

- **Pattern = dimensional expression**  
- **Residual = structural identity**

---

## 2. Two-way Stability Structure

### Pattern-Stability (procedural)
- arises from repeated operations  
- domain-shaped  
- scalable, removable  
- stable only when procedural rules stay fixed  

### Kernel-Stability (structural)
- irreducible  
- invariant across transformations  
- non-removable without destroying identity  

Thus:

- **pattern = mapping schema**  
- **kernel = identity carrier**

---

## 3. Generalized Linear Form

### Scalar  
$$
y = bx + c
$$

### Multidimensional  
$$
\mathbf{y} = B\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{c}
$$

Interpretation:

- **c** = invariant kernel  
- **Bx** = pattern-dependent projection  
- **y** = kernel presented under a pattern  

If **c** vanishes, the model anchors stability on **x**, which is variable.  
Therefore, kernel-first modeling is structurally necessary.

## 4. Kernel-Generated Presentation Space

Define:

𝐘₍𝐜₎ = { 𝐁𝐱 + 𝐜  |  𝐁, 𝐱 ∈ 𝐃 }

Meaning:

- kernel is fixed  
- pattern layer (B, x) varies  
- each **y** is a distinct presentation of the same identity kernel  

Two reading modes:

- **Pattern-first**: fix (B, x) → explore points inside \(Y_{(\mathbf{c})}\)  
- **Residual-first**: identify kernel **c** → derive the entire space  

Residual-first provides the **topological origin**.

---

## 5. Why Complex Systems Feel “Hard”
**Pattern-coupling principle**

Pattern-first modeling begins in a tangled layer:

- **B** encodes interactions  
- **x** carries entanglement  
- domain-specific patterns introduce coupling by construction  

Thus:

**Complexity is inherited from the modeling layer, not the system.**

Residual-first removes inherited coupling at the start.

---

## 6. Residual-First as Natural Decoupling

Start from:

$$
\mathbf{y} = B\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{c} \Rightarrow \mathbf{c}
$$

Residual (**c**) has **zero internal coupling**, so it defines a clean origin.

Two-layer modeling emerges:

### Layer 1 — Kernel Layer  
- find the invariant  
- define the structural origin  
- domain-independent  

### Layer 2 — Pattern Projection Layer  
- (B, x) differ across fields  
- determines dimension and surface form  
- kernel stays unchanged  

This yields a clean generative separation:  
**structure first → projection second**.

---

## 7. Cross-Domain Validation (Invariance Test)

A generative theory is strong only if the kernel survives domain shift.

### DNA  
- kernel = sequence  
- pattern = expression machinery  
- phenotype = kernel projection

### Input–Output Systems  
- kernel = IO relation  
- pattern = code / matrix / function  
- output = presentation of the same mapping

### Language  
- kernel = semantic core  
- pattern = syntax/phonology  
- surface form = semantic presentation

### Neural Models  
- kernel = latent representation  
- pattern = weight matrices and nonlinearity  
- embedding = kernel under projection

Cross-domain invariance confirms the kernel-first stance.

---

## 8. Two-way-Closure Stability

A model becomes coherent when:

the kernel settles,

the pattern schema settles,

and both point back to the same origin.

Meaning:

Identity is stable from both the inside (kernel) and the outside (pattern).
This gives stability even when the domain changes.

---

## 9. Why Residual-First Is the Only Complete Strategy

Residual-first modeling offers:

- structural invariance  
- decoupling before projection  
- cross-domain generalization  
- generative completeness  
- minimal assumptions  
- maximal stability  

Pattern-first modeling provides:

- inherited coupling  
- domain-dependent instability  
- reduced generalization  
- absence of identity anchor  

Thus the universal paradigm is:

$$
\text{Model} = \text{Projection}(\text{Kernel})
$$

and not:

$$
\text{Model} = \text{Pattern} + \text{Error}
$$

Kernel carries identity;  
pattern shapes the presentation.
