# patpatjae — Structural Cognition Repository  
*A semi-formal archive of residual-based generative systems, frameworks, and live traces.*

---

## What This Repository Is

This is **not** an open-source codebase.  
It is a **structural cognition archive** documenting a generative system that emerged through:

- residual-first reasoning  
- lived structural mapping  
- cross-domain projection  
- tension-field analysis  
- high-density conceptual generation  

All materials originate from a **non-academic**, **non-institutional**,  
**naturally emergent cognitive process**.

This space functions as a **research-facing window** into how my generative mind operates.

## What This Repository Is *Not*

To avoid misunderstanding:

- ❌ not an open-source framework  
- ❌ not a library intended for reuse or absorption  
- ❌ not model-training material  
- ❌ not a multi-author collaborative project  

This repository exists for **review**, **evaluation**, and **intellectual traceability**,  
not for extraction or integration into public models.

Researchers may read, analyze, or reference ideas here —  
but structural frameworks remain **non-transferable intellectual work**.

## Core Components in This Repository

### **Framework A — Illusion, Creativity & Generativity**  
A semi-formal sequence redefining illusion as structural overflow.  
→ *See `/FrameworkA`*

### **Boundary Layer (D01)**  
Pre-validation structure: ownership, collapse conditions, stabilization.  
Raw, intentionally unpolished.  
→ *See `/FrameworkA` (Boundary_D01)*

### **Residual-First Generative Modeling**  
Mathematical and structural anchor: Euclidean residual → kernel-first modeling.  
→ *See `/Framework0`*

### **TEEM — Two-Emergence Engine Model**  
Dual generative engine:  
collapse emergence (tension → token)  
assign emergence (token → tension).  
→ *See `/Onepages` (TEEM)*

### **GMD_001 — Generative Mind Diagnostic**  
A real-time spatiotemporal cognition test demonstrating live generativity.  
→ *See `/Generative-demos`*

### **Raw Trace Logs**  
Unsegmented cognitive flow showing spontaneous structural generation  
under everyday conditions.  
→ *See `/FrameworkB`*

### **Ethics E01–E02 (Structural IP)**  
Why structural cognition is non-transferable,  
and why frameworks require protected domain boundaries.  
→ *See `/Onepages` (E-series)*

## Why This Repository Exists

This archive serves three functions:

1. **Research-facing transparency**  
   Reviewers can observe generative structure formation directly.

2. **Intellectual provenance**  
   Structural patterns originate from a single generator  
   and must remain attributable.

3. **Invitation for dialogue**  
   Researchers may reach out for collaboration, supervision, or exploration.
