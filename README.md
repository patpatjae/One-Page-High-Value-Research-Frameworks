# One-Page High-Value Research Frameworks

This repository collects a set of **one-page conceptual frameworks**
generated through a live, generative cognitive process.

Rather than presenting finished theories,
each one-page captures a **structural residual**:
a moment where a generative mechanism,
a framing shift, or a cross-domain mapping becomes visible.

The emphasis is not on domain coverage,
but on **how structure emerges** under unfamiliar or weakly defined conditions.

## What This Repository Is

- A curated collection of **one-page frameworks**
- Each page is **self-contained**, but many form conceptual sequences
- The focus is on:
  - generative mechanisms  
  - residual-first reasoning  
  - dimensional mismatch  
  - cross-domain structural alignment  

These notes are designed to be readable independently,
but reward sequential reading.

## How to Read

Some frameworks are grouped into sequences
(where later pages build directly on earlier ones).
Others stand alone as isolated generative artifacts.

If a sequence exists, it is indicated in the local README of that section.
Otherwise, each one-page can be treated as an independent entry point.

## Generative Provenance Note

The frameworks in this repository are not fixed artifacts,
but instances of a reproducible generative process.

They are curated for clarity, but not dependent on stored traces.
Equivalent structures can be regenerated under new contexts when needed.

Raw emergence traces may exist,
but reproducibility does not rely on archival recall.
